I'm an incoming MPhil/PhD student in the Department of Statistical Science at University College London, where I will be working with [Ricardo Silva](https://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~ucgtrbd/), [Karla Diaz-Ordaz](https://kdiazordaz.github.io/), and [Jeremias Knoblauch](https://jeremiasknoblauch.github.io). Previously (2022-2025), I completed my BSc in Statistics and Data Science at the University of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, where I was fortunate to work with [Rafael Izbicki](https://rafaelizbicki.com). During the first semester of 2024, I spent an awesome semester as visiting student at KAUST, where I worked with [Paula Moraga](https://www.paulamoraga.com/) on statistical methods for dengue outbreak detection in Brazil.
